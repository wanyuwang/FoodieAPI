# MyAPI

As a foodie, I had wrote two API to get restaurants data from public food magazins at Foursquare and Yelp. 

The one that I list is for Foursquare.

By calling this API, we can get:
1. restanrants name
2. location
3. description
4. city
5. type
...

This API can fit for almost all of the food magazins at Foursquare:
1. Eater
2. 7 * 7 Magazine
3. Food Network
4. Foursquare City Guide
5. Fodor's 
...
